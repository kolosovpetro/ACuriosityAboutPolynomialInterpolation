\subsection{Version for even powers}\label{subsec:even_powers}
We have the \hyperref[itm:cubes-algorithm]{algorithm} to obtain identities for
cubes~\eqref{eq:move-n-under-sigma} and~\eqref{eq:alter-summation-bounds}, as well as
a set of real coefficients $\coeffA{m}{r}$ such that
\begin{align*}
    n^{2m+1} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \coeffA{m}{0} k^0 (n-k)^0 + \coeffA{m}{1} (n-k)^1
    + \cdots + \coeffA{m}{m} k^m (n-k)^m
\end{align*}
Is there analog for even powers?
