\subsection{Relation with triangular numbers}\label{subsec:relation_with_triangular_numbers}
I have spotted that finite difference of cubes can be expressed in terms of triangular numbers, i.e.
\begin{align*}
    \Delta n^3  = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=0}^{n} k = 1 + 6 \binom{n+1}{2}
\end{align*}
where $\binom{n+1}{2}$ are triangular numbers,
see OEIS sequence \href{https://oeis.org/A000217}{\texttt{A000217}}~\cite{oeis_sloane2015triangular}.
I wander is there a relation between $\Delta n^5$ and pentagonal numbers~\cite{oeis_sloane2010pentagonal} as well\ldots
\begin{question}
    Is there a relation between $N$-sided polygon numbers and finite differences of odd powers $2m+1$?
\end{question}
