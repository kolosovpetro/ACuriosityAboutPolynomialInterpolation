\subsection{Literature}\label{subsec:literature}
The \hyperref[itm:cubes-algorithm]{algorithm} we used to obtain identities for
cubes~\eqref{eq:move-n-under-sigma} and~\eqref{eq:alter-summation-bounds} is quite simple, if not naive.
I believe it should be discussed in mathematical literature, as well as conjecture~\eqref{conj:generalization}
that gives a set of real coefficients $\coeffA{m}{r}$ such that
\begin{align*}
    n^{2m+1} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \coeffA{m}{0} k^0 (n-k)^0 + \coeffA{m}{1} (n-k)^1
    + \cdots + \coeffA{m}{m} k^m (n-k)^m
\end{align*}
However, I was not able to find any references that in particular mention coefficients $\coeffA{m}{r}$,
which is one of open questions.
